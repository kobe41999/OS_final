=head1 NAME

elevator.pl - a multi-threaded elevator simulator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  elevator.pl --elevators 3 --people 10 --floors 10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program simulates a building with elevators and people.  The
people get on the elevators and ride them to their destinations.  Then
they get off and wait a while.  Finally, the people travel to the
ground floor and leave the building.  Statistics are collected
measuring the efficiency of the elevators from the perspective of the
people.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are available to control the simulation:

  --elevators      - number of elevators in the building (default 3)

  --floors         - number of floors in the building (default 20)

  --people         - number of people to create (default 10)

  --elevator-speed - how long an elevator takes to travel one floor, 
                     in seconds (default .25)

  --elevator-wait  - how long an elevator waits at a floor for passengers,
                     in seconds (default .5)

  --people-freq    - how many people are created per second (default 2)

  --people-wait    - how long a person spends on their destination floor, 
                     in seconds (default 5)
